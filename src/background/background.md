# Background

This chapter of this book is an overview of how to build C/C++ programs.
Briefly covering topics such as clang command line invocations, shared libraries,
and static libraries.

For a much much deeper dive, I recommend reading the paper [How To Write Shared Libraries](https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf)
by Ulrich Drepper.
