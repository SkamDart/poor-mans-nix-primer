# Sharing Code

Simple programs like the "hello world" we wrote on the previous page are nice
but not very practical. Lucky for us, humans are good at hierarchical decomposition
and recomposition while computers are good at blatantly obeying us and 
computations incredibly fast. That said, we need a way to share code without needing
to copy and paste source code, Makefiles, etc.

In a Linux based system, there are two ways to do this, a _static library_ and a _shared library_
denoted by `.a` and `.so` respectively.
